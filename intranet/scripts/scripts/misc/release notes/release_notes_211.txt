The next release will probably be 2.2RC1.
It should contains :
* bugfixes.
* some new code for a better LDAP handling (automatic creation of the borrower if it does not exist, getting informations from LDAP directory)
* a barcode generator ! it's a new feature that should be commited by a new developper coming from south america (argentina). I've seen the code, it's clean & nice. Just a new dependencay, for PDF generating. Should be non mandatory for ppl that don't want to print barcodes.
