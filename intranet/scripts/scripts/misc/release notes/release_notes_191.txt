RELEASE NOTES
* standard acquisition and MARC cataloguing now both useable at the same time.
* MANY bugfixes.
* almost everything now templated. A few admin scripts still to template.
* inclusion of some  pictures to say "add", "modify", "delete" in many places.
* the koha-html cvs tree is now UNUSED, and no mode included in this release. the koha cvs project contains everything.

TODO
* z39.50 support. A port from the 1.2.x z39.50 support needs to be done. Should be quick,
* fixing bugs. If you find a bug in this version, please take the plane and go for a trip to : bugs.koha.org

FEATURE FREEZE
feature freeze is there... only z39.50 will be added until 2.0RC1, which should be the next release !

KNOWN BUGS *IMPORTANT* :
* koha does NOT work with MARC::Record 1.12. It works fine with MARC::Record 0.93, and maybe with other versions.
* repeted subfields in MARC/iso2709 works poorly : only the 1st subfield is stored, other are ignored. At least, the 1st is right ! (in the 1.9.0, the 1st was buggied by other subfields too)
* In the MARC search, the "not" flag does not work : the result of the query is very strange !
* en and fr are the only languages well supported in this version. Other translator teams are waiting for more stable templates :-)
