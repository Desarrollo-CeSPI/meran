RELEASE NOTES
=============
Bugfixes & some improvements (security & perf only)
It has been placed in the "unstable tree" because there are still some bugs.
But it's fully usable, and should not be modified a lot until a stable version is released.

DB modifications :
---------
None, but check that your systempreferences table is :
CREATE TABLE systempreferences (
  variable varchar(50) NOT NULL default '',
  value varchar(200) default NULL,
  explanation varchar(200) NOT NULL default '',
  options text,
  type varchar(20) default NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (variable)
) PACK_KEYS=1;

If you installed a 2.0.0pre1 from scratch, it should be ok.
If your version was a 1.9.x, it should not be ok.

SYSTEMPREFS :
---------
In systempreferences, add a gist field. Used to calculate gst when ordering, in acquisition module. Enter 0.12 for 12% rate.

* checkmarc.pl : added a check on fields mapped to item marc tag (by Paul).
* overdue books backported from 1.2.x (& templated) (by Chris)
