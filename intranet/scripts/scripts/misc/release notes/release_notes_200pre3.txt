RELEASE NOTES
=============

This version of Koha is still in the "unstable" directory, because some bugs are still reported. But it's fully useable and used in (at least) 3 libraries in "real world" :
* Nelsonville Public Library, Ohio, USA
* Esiee, high school, France
* Dombes Abbey, France

The next version should/might be the 2.0.0RC1.
The only missing features are :
* a migration tool for libraries already using Koha1.2.x
* an automated upgrading tool for future version. It's possible to upgrade manually.

IMPROVEMENTS :
---------
* adding a demo setup : if you set "demo=1" in /etc/koha.conf, Koha is in "demo mode". In this mode, user can connect with "demo/demo", even if this user is not in members table.
He can do everything, except that any modif/add/delete done in systempref or marc structure is NOT saved in the DB. This avoid demo user breaking the demo config.
* adding javascript function to focus on 1st field for issues / returns. Thus, librarian don't need manual mouse focus & can scan barcode immediatly.
* authories/thesaurus management : adding the possibility to add an authority directly.

UPGRADING :
---------
People using a previous 2.0.0preX version can upgrade code and use the same DB, there's no DB change.
To upgrade mannually :
- mv /etc/koha.conf /etc/koha.conf_previous
- install in a new directory /var/www/html/koha_200pre3 for example.
- delete the 2.0.0pre3 DB
- modify /etc/koha.conf to point to 2.0.0pre3 DB
- modify httpd.conf to have Koha root directory pointing to 200pre3 install instead of 200pre2
- restart Apache.

Note : you can use the 2.0.0pre2 login/password.
If you do, mySQL may complaint about "already existing DB user". It's not a problem.

Note : you can also use "CVS symlink installation" of Koha if you prefer. See http://www.saas.nsw.edu.au/wiki/index.php?page=CVSSymLinkInstallation
