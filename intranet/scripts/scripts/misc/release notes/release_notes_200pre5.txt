RELEASE NOTES
=============
this version of Koha is the last one of the 2.0.0 series in the "unstable" tree.
5 libraries are using it, so it's quite useable.
2 last problems have to be solved before 2.0.0RC1 :
* biblio deletion : at the moment, biblio deletion is buggy (does not work in MARC, delete only non-marc data)
* upgrader is provided for the 1st time, so it's probably buggy.

If you want to use Koha, you're welcomed, but you're warned that this version still has some bugs and missing features.

INSTALLATION
==========
* Download the package
* tar xvfz koha-version.tar.gz

NOTE: You will need to add lines to your main httpd.conf to include
/etc/koha-httpd.conf and to make sure it is listening on the right ports
(using the Listen directive). Previous versions updated the httpd.conf file,
some users thought it was bad/poor decision.
