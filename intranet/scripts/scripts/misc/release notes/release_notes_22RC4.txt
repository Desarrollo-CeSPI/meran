WARNING
========
* This version is in the stable tree of Koha, but still evaluated as "Release Candidate". A few bugs are still known or have to be found, maybe by you. But it's stable enough to be used in production.
* This version is only available in ENGLISH and FRENCH. Many languages to come. Spanish (Argentina) is also available. May be a little buggy anyway.
* Biblio frameworks :
  - In UNIMARC - french. Frameworks are defined and can be set up during installation for : old documents, cartographies, electronic documents, microfilms, monographies, serials, films and images, "tire à part"
  - In English, only a default framework is provided. If you define specific frameworks, mail paul _at_ koha-fr.org or a koha mailing list to know how to add them to official release.
* the librarian interface is tested only with mozilla/firefox. Should work (partially) with IE. OPAC should work fine with any navigator.
* Any 2.1.x install must be uninstalled before installing 2.2.0 No update is provided for 2.1.0.

BUGFIXES

***** Critical
1 CRITICAL bug in acquisition (another one...) : when MARC=ON, and an order line is created from an existing biblio (to buy another item), the MARC biblio is lost and replaced by the non marc one (that has a lot less informations...). To solve the problem, the biblio can no more be modified after the order has been placed. Less feature, but more reliable ! (not simple solution to solve this problem. Would imply to rewrite the MARC biblio from the non marc datas, and no API is provided for this yet)
2 CRITICAL bugfix in Biblio.pm, removing &branches declaration (was due to an untested cvs rollback, opac-search.pl was crashing)
3 CRITICAL bugfix in Biblio.pm when MARC=OFF. subjects were stored and immediatly deleted. And not stored correctly in MARC part of the biblio. (thanks to Waylon Robertson)

***** Minor
1 bugfix in updatedatabase (auth_header creation table). Don't affect previous install of 2.2, only upgrades 2.0 => 2.2
2 reading rec : Fixing link to toggle between full and limited display
3 bugfix for moremember.pl that no longer outputed item type for issues
4 defaulting actual cost to estimated cost (was 0 by default)
5 bugfix : in biblio search, - and other signs where not properly managed. Leroy-Beaulieu could not be found
6 the popup of the 210c plugin closes when a collection is choosed
7 bugfix : could not select a biblio in subscription creation if the book was not for loan
8 minor fixes in spelling in subscription
9 adding acquisition in default userflags. This flag can be set for librarians that have access to acquisition
10 in subscription enddate calculation, bugfix when subscription based on number of issues (worked when based on subscription length)
11 in subscription next issue date calculation, bugfix when subscription frequency is 1/quarter.
12 datelastseen is updated when the book is returned
13 moredetail.pl shows incorrect date, incorrectly formatted (bug #689)
14 DuplicateFinder has been disabled : sometimes goes into a looonnnggg lasting loop.
15 when a query returns only one result, adding it to basket did not work.
16 deletion of a suggestion was buggy. Now fixed
17 for installation of Koha under Windows there is a bug with subject splitting. Now fixed. (thanks to Waylon Robertson)

IMPROVEMENTS
***** Major
1 a lot in book shelves
2 Submitting with no barcode in issues should clear for next patron (bug #865)
3 screen added to see late issues from a given bookseller
4 Koha should now work under mod_perl (Release Manager don't use mod_perl. fixes comes from A. Tarallo, Argentina, that ensure Koha works fine with mod_perl with the patches applied)

**** Minor
1 show also item tags into marc list of fields (in librarian search interface)
2 email sent basket : the sender can give it's name, in case the basket is sent to a friend, not to itself
3 removing useless string in isbd view
4 cataloguing, in isbnsearch, after searching a title/ISBN, the librarian can choose the framework (+ it's a cataloguing screen, not an acquisition one)
5 serials : in issues management, the waited/late issues bloc is before the collection state bloc.
6 serials : the intranet note has been removed, it's useless
7 after an authority is added/modified, go to this fresh authority (instead of authority-home)
8 search option in auth-top
9 in OPAC, the itemcallnumber search is a "start by" search (was a contains)
10 opac note is defaulted to '' (was 0, that means nothing)
11 adding blank to relshiploop (altrelationship) loop (Bug ???)
12 when deleting an itemtype, don't check issuingrules, but delete them too
13 For MARC=OFF installation, Waylon submitted a script to rebuild MARC part of the catalogue. It's in misc/updatemarc_subjects.pl (thanks to Waylon Robertson)

* Download the package
* tar xvfz koha-version.tar.gz
* cd koha-version

********
UPGRADE TO A 2.0.0 version before upgrading

=============
NEW FEATURES
=============
Koha 2.2 has, of course, all the previous features from Koha (acquisition, cataloguing, circulation, members modules, OPAC, complete MARC support...) plus the following new ones :

General :
*********
* (almost) complete rewrite of librarian GUI : now Koha uses CSS, and is easier to use. However, users of Koha 2.0.0 won't be lost, as the general organisation of the product has not changed.
* Online Help : an online help is available everywhere in the librarian interface. It's complete in the parameters section of Koha and for new features. It will be completed for the rest of the product.
* Better LDAP suport : Koha 2.2 can be "connected" to a LDAP server and get all borrower informations from there (including borrower category where applicable). However, to avoid problems for libraries without LDAP server, the LDAP features have been stored in modules/C4/Auth_with_ldap.pm file. The standard Auth.pm don't use it. If you want LDAP, just perldoc Auth_with_ldap.pm and manually tune your Auth package !

Acquisition :
*************
* suggestion : borrowers can suggest items to buy in OPAC. Then, the librarian can manage (accept or refuse) and order them.
* possibility to close a basket, he can't be modified then
* order a basket by publisher or by bookfund/publisher
* search order history

Cataloguing :
*************
* Cataloguing frameworks : you can define as many frameworks as you want. A framework describes how a material is catalogued (which fields, subfields, which constraints on them...)
* MARC authorities : Koha now supports authorities in MARC. You can define the MARC structure for authorities like for biblios.
* New contraints can be set for subfields :
  - subfield is hidden : appears in MARC editor, but not in OPAC.
  - subfield is an URL : the field can be cliqued
  - related fields : a search made on a subfield also uses other subfields automatically. Using this feature, a search on "title" can search title, but also subtitle, uniform title,...
* Item location can now be done on 3 levels : the branch, the location (room), the callnumber.
* The callnumber can now be calculated from the LC, the dewey, or be freely (and manually) entered.
* Duplicate finder : this powerful feature help your cataloguers avoiding duplicate biblios.
* ISBD view : in librarian interface as well as in OPAC biblios can be shown in standard (default) presentation, in MARC (human readable) or ISBD. The ISBD view can be tuned by the librarian team.

Serial cataloguing :
********************
Koha 2.2 manage serial subscriptions and issuing of those subscriptions.

Catalogue search :
******************
* Search in OPAC and librarian interface has been improved. They now are exactly the same.
* Spelling suggestion : before sending a request, the user can ask for spelling suggestion. This shows other forms of words entered that would give results.
* The user can select the order of the results

Circulation :
*************
* New issuing rules : Issuing can be set for branch / borrower type / item category, by number of days and number of items available.
* "joker" issuing rules : the library can set issuing rules for "any branch" or "any borrower type", or "any item category".
Both issuing rules are cumulative : a library can set issuing rules to 10 books, 5 CD, but 12 total (books or CD).

OPAC :
******
In Koha 2.2, koha has :
* baskets. A basket can be printed or sent by mail to the borrower
* virtual shelves : a virtual shelf can be created and filled by any logged borrower. A given virtual shelf can be private or public. Or even free-for-all.
* language chooser : the borrower can change the language on the fly. The default language being still choosen by the library

Barcode printing :
******************
A new module has been added to the parameters section : barcode printing. It requires the PDF::Api2 Perl package and can print barcode on 

============
