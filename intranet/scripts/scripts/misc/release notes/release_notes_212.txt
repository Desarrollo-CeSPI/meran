UPGRADE from previous 1.2.x version :
UPGRADE TO A 2.0.0 version before upgrading to 2.1.2
This will be mandatory for the 2.2 official release.

UPDATE from a 2.1.x version is NOT AVAILABLE. Don't install 2.1.2 on a 2.1.x test database. A lot of DB changes have been done since 2.1.x & could not be handled by the DB updater.

============
WHAT'S NEW
============
* Barcode printing : a barcode printing module has been added in the "parameters" module. It requires PDF::API2 Perl module. this requirement is NOT tested by the installer, and will be non-mandatory on official 2.2.0 release.
* A lot of bugfixes. The list is too long to be done.

This "snapshot" is a good basis for translation process. Feel free to subscribe to koha-translate and become involved in a localisation to your own language.

===========
WHAT'S NEXT
===========
This version is quite stable. The next one should be called "2.2.0RC1".
It still requires some work in LDAP handling.
