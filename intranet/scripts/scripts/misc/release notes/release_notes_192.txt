RELEASE NOTES
=============
* koha does NOT work with MARC::Record 1.12. It works fine with MARC::Record 0.93, and maybe with other versions.
* In the MARC search, the "not" flag does not work : the result of the query is very strange !
* en and fr are the only languages well supported in this version. Other translator teams are waiting for more stable templates.
* see interim.txt, which contains install notes
