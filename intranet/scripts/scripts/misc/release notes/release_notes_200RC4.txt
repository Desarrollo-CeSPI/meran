RELEASE NOTES
=============
This version of Koha is the 4rd in the 2.0 "stable" series.
It does not mean that it has no bugs, but many libraries are using it and don't encounter unsolvable problems.
If you want to adopt Koha, please do, but you're warned that this release candidate version may still have some bugs and missing features.
If you test it and let us know about any we haven't seen yet, it will help us to fix them.

BUGFIXES/IMPROVEMENTS:

BUGS FIXED:
major :
* #293 : Error Issuing Book  - 1 (a very old one...)
* #605 : circulation.pl only shows one waiting item
* #661 : Set three variables for the circ template: gna, lost, and dbarred
* biblio deletion : in some cases, the biblio deletion was done on another biblio than the one asked.
* indicators where stored but not displayed in MARC editor/viewer.
* book shelves work again (note bookshelves are not avaible in OPAC. they will be added in 2.2.0)
minor :
* it's now impossible to create a basket for an inactive supplier (it's of course possible to change supplier datas and recieve a past order)
* removing "bulk", useless field, in admin/categorie.pl list (NOT in DB, in case someone uses the field)
* removing forced order in admin/thesaurus.pl => mySQL returns datas ordered by relevance in fulltext index if you don't force an order.
* Next borrower didn't work in circulation.pl (didn't return to borrower form)
* in circulation.pl, removing <br> to have all informations without sidebar on a 1024x768 screen.
* in circulation.pl, ODUES are in red in borrower header
* quoting correctly titles with a " inside, in MARC editor

IMPROVEMENTS:
* Minor translation & HTML fixes.
* Adding >>> in biblio editor to change tab.
* Adding a "print" link in MARCbiblio : popup a small windows, print the biblio, and closes. Nice for libraries still having a paper catalog.
