WHAT'S NEW
============
* A lot of bugfixes. The list is too long to be done.
* adding possibility to order orders by publisher and/or budget/publisher
* adding search history feature in orders
* adding minor features to barcode generator :
	- possibility to print continuous barcodes numbers, but not from items 
	- possibility to replace the title/author by a manually typed text under the barcode itself.
* The borrowernote field is shown on issue and transfer
* The textmessaging field appears in OPAC when the user logs in
* When a field is repeated, the new field is now created after the existing one
* a plugin has been added for UNIMARC for 210c (editor) and 225a (collection)
- create a authority category called "EDITORS"
- set :
200$a => ISBN
200$b => editor
200$c => (repeatable) collection.

Then enter, for example :
$a 23
$b Hachette Litterature
$c collection1|collection2|collection3

map your "editor" field to plugin 210c, your "collection" field to plugin 225a
Once you arrive on the editor field, if the beginning of the ISBN exists, the editor is automatically found.
Once you arrive on collection field, click on ... you can choose in the collection list.

The 210c / 225a comes from the UNIMARC editor/collection field, but should work as well with MARC21.

===========
WHAT'S NEXT
===========
This version is quite stable. The next one should be called "2.2.0RC1".
It still requires some work in LDAP handling.
