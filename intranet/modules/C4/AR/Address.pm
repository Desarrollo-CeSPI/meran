Email::Address - RFC 2822 Address Parsing and Creation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Email::Address;

  my @addresses = Email::Address->parse($line);
  my $address   = Email::Address->new(Casey => 'casey@localhost');

  print $address->format;

version 1.886

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements a regex-based RFC 2822 parser that locates email
addresses in strings and returns a list of C<Email::Address> objects found.
Alternatley you may construct objects manually. The goal of this software is to
be correct, and very very fast.

=head2 Package Variables

Several regular expressions used in this package are useful to others.
For convenience, these variables are declared as package variables that
you may access from your program.

These regular expressions conform to the rules specified in RFC 2822.

You can access these variables using the full namespace. If you want
short names, define them yourself.

  my $addr_spec = $Email::Address::addr_spec;

=over 4

=item $Email::Address::addr_spec

This regular expression defined what an email address is allowed to
look like.

=item $Email::Address::angle_addr

This regular expression defines an C<$addr_spec> wrapped in angle
brackets.

=item $Email::Address::name_addr

This regular expression defines what an email address can look like
with an optional preceeding display name, also known as the C<phrase>.

=item $Email::Address::mailbox

This is the complete regular expression defining an RFC 2822 emial
address with an optional preceeding display name and optional
following comment.

=head2 Class Methods

=over 4

=item parse

  my @addrs = Email::Address->parse(
    q[me@local, Casey <me@local>, "Casey" <me@local> (West)]
  );

This method returns a list of C<Email::Address> objects it finds
in the input string.

The specification for an email address allows for infinitley
nestable comments. That's nice in theory, but a little over done.
By default this module allows for two (C<2>) levels of nested
comments. If you think you need more, modify the
C<$Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL> package variable to allow
more.

  $Email::Address::COMMENT_NEST_LEVEL = 10; # I'm deep

The reason for this hardly limiting limitation is simple: efficiency.

Long strings of whitespace can be problematic for this module to parse, a bug
which has not yet been adequately addressed.  The default behavior is now to
collapse multiple spaces into a single space, which avoids this problem.  To
prevent this behavior, set C<$Email::Address::COLLAPSE_SPACES> to zero.  This
variable will go away when the bug is resolved properly.

  my $address = Email::Address->new('Casey West', 'casey@local');
  my $address = Email::Address->new(undef, 'casey@local', '(Casey)');

Constructs and returns a new C<Email::Address> object. Takes four
positional arguments: phrase, email, and comment, and original string.

The original string should only really be set using C<parse>.

=item purge_cache

  Email::Address->purge_cache;

One way this module stays fast is with internal caches. Caches live
in memory and there is the remote possibility that you will have a
memory problem. In the off chance that you think you're one of those
people, this class method will empty those caches.

I've loaded over 12000 objects and not encountered a memory problem.

=item disable_cache

=item enable_cache

  Email::Address->disable_cache if memory_low();

If you'd rather not cache address parses at all, you can disable (and reenable) the Email::Address cache with these methods.  The cache is enabled by default.

=item name

  my $name = $address->name;

This method tries very hard to determine the name belonging to the address.
First the C<phrase> is checked. If that doesn't work out the C<comment>
is looked into. If that still doesn't work out, the C<user> portion of
the C<address> is returned.

This method does B<not> try to massage any name it identifies and instead
leaves that up to someone else. Who is it to decide if someone wants their
name capitalized, or if they're Irish?

=item stringify

Objects stringify to C<format> by default. It's possible that you don't
like that idea. Okay, then, you can change it by modifying
C<$Email:Address::STRINGIFY>. Please consider modifying this package
variable using C<local>. You might step on someone else's toes if you
don't.

...unfortunately, a known bug causes a loss of speed the string to parse has
certain known characteristics, and disabling cache will also degrade
performance.
