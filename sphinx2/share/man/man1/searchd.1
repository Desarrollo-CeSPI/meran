.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
Sphinx is a collection of programs that aim to provide high quality fulltext search\&.
.PP
Searchd is the second of the two principle tools as part of Sphinx\&.
\fBsearchd\fR
is the part of the system which actually handles searches; it functions as a server and is responsible for receiving queries, processing them and returning a dataset back to the different APIs for client applications\&.
.PP
Unlike
\fBindexer\fR,
\fBsearchd\fR
is not designed to be run either from a regular script or command\-line calling, but instead either as a daemon to be called from
\fIinit\&.d\fR
(on Unix/Linux type systems) or to be called as a service (on Windows\-type systems)\&. so not all of the command line options will always apply, and so will be build\-dependent\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
These programs follow the usual GNU command line syntax, with long options starting with two dashes (`\-\*(Aq)\&.
.PP
The options available to searchd on all builds are:
.PP
\fB\-\-config\fR\fICONFIGFILE\fR, \fB\-c\fR\fICONFIGFILE\fR
.RS 4
Tell
\fBsearchd\fR
to use the given file as its configuration, just as with
\fBindexer\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-console\fR
.RS 4
Force
\fBsearchd\fR
into console mode; typically it will be running as a conventional server application, and will aim to dump information into the log files (as specified in
sphinx\&.conf)\&. Sometimes though, when debugging issues in the configuration or the daemon itself, or trying to diagnose hard\-to\-track\-down problems, it may be easier to force it to dump information directly to the console/command line from which it is being called\&. Running in console mode also means that the process will not be forked (so searches are done in sequence) and logs will not be written to\&. (It should be noted that console mode is not the intended method for running searchd\&.)
.sp
You can invoke it as such:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-config /home/myuser/sphinx\&.conf \-\-console
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-cpustats\fR
.RS 4
Used to provide actual CPU time report (in addition to wall time) in both query log file (for every given query) and status report (aggregated)\&. It depends on
\fIclock_gettime()\fR
system call and might therefore be unavailable on certain systems\&.
.sp
You might start searchd thus:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-config /home/myuser/sphinx\&.conf \-\-cpustats
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR, \fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-?\fR, \fB\-?\fR
.RS 4
List all of the parameters that can be called in your particular build of
\fBsearchd\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-index\fR\ \&\fIINDEX\fR, \fB\-i\fR\ \&\fIINDEX\fR
.RS 4
Serve only the specified index\&. Like
\fB\-\-port\fR, this is usually for debugging purposes; more long\-term changes would generally be applied to the configuration file itself\&.
.sp
Usage example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-index myindex
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-iostats\fR
.RS 4
Used in conjuction with the logging options (the
\fBquery_log\fR
will need to have been activated in
sphinx\&.conf) to provide more detailed information on a per\-query basis as to the input/output operations carried out in the course of that query, with a slight performance hit and of course bigger logs\&. Further details are available under the query log format section\&.
.sp
You might start searchd thus:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-config /home/myuser/sphinx\&.conf \-\-iostats
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-listen\fR, \fB\-l\fR\ \&\fI( address ":" port | port | path ) [ ":" protocol ]\fR
.RS 4
Works as
\fB\-\-port\fR, but allow you to specify not only the port, but full path, as IP address and port, or Unix\-domain socket path, that
\fBsearchd\fR
will listen on\&. Otherwords, you can specify either an IP address (or hostname) and port number, or just a port number, or Unix socket path\&. If you specify port number but not the address, searchd will listen on all network interfaces\&. Unix path is identified by a leading slash\&. As the last param you can also specify a protocol handler (listener) to be used for connections on this socket\&. Supported protocol values are \*(Aqsphinx\*(Aq (Sphinx 0\&.9\&.x API protocol) and \*(Aqmysql41\*(Aq (MySQL protocol used since 4\&.1 upto at least 5\&.1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-logdebug, \-\-logdebugv, \-\-logdebugvv\fR
.RS 4
Enable additional debug output in the daemon log\&. Should only be needed rarely, to assist with debugging issues that could not be easily reproduced on request\&.
\fB\-\-logdebug\fR
causes daemon to fire general debug messages\&.
\fB\-\-logdebugv\fR
and
\fB\-\-logdebugvv\fR
points to \*(Aqverbose\*(Aq and \*(Aqvery verbose\*(Aq debug info\&. The last could really flood your logfile\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-nodetach\fR
.RS 4
Do not \*(Aqdaemonize\*(Aq, or, do not detach into background\&. Apart debug purposes, this switch is useful when you manage sphinx with upstart init daemon\&. In this case actual \*(Aqdaemonizing\*(Aq will be done by upstart itself, and also all tasks like starting, stopping, reloading the config and respawning on crash will be done by the system, not the sphinx\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-pidfile\fR \fIPIDFILE\fR
.RS 4
Explicitly state a PID file, where the process information is stored regarding
\fBsearchd\fR, used for inter\-process communications (for example,
\fBindexer\fR
will need to know the PID to contact
\fBsearchd\fR
for rotating indexes)\&. Normally,
\fBsearchd\fR
would use a PID if running in regular mode (i\&.e\&. not with
\fB\-\-console\fR), but it is possible that you will be running it in console mode whilst the index is being updated and rotated, for which a PID file will be needed\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-config /home/myuser/sphinx\&.conf \-\-pidfile /home/myuser/sphinx\&.pid
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-replay\-flags\fR\ \&\fIOPTIONS\fR
.RS 4
Specify a list of extra binary log replay options\&. The supported options are:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fBaccept\-desc\-timestamp\fR, ignore descending transaction timestamps and replay such transactions anyway (the default behavior is to exit with an error)\&.
.RE
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-replay\-flags=accept\-desc\-timestamp
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-port\fR\ \&\fIPORT\fR, \fB\-p\fR\ \&\fIPORT\fR
.RS 4
Specify the
\fIport\fR
that
\fBsearchd\fR
should listen on, usually for debugging purposes\&. This will usually default to
\fB9312\fR, but sometimes you need to run it on a different port\&. Specifying it on the command line will override anything specified in the configuration file\&. The valid range is 0 to 65535, but ports numbered 1024 and below usually require a privileged account in order to run\&. Look also the
\fB\-\-listen\fR
option, it will give you more possibilities to tune here\&.
.sp
An example of usage:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-port 9313
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-status\fR
.RS 4
Query running
\fBsearchd\fR
instance status, using the connection details from the (optionally) provided configuration file\&. It will try to connect to the running instance using the first configured UNIX socket or TCP port\&. On success, it will query for a number of status and performance counter values and print them\&. You can use
\fIStatus()\fR
API call to access the very same counters from your application\&.
.sp
Examples:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-status
$ searchd \-\-config /home/myuser/sphinx\&.conf \-\-status
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stop\fR
.RS 4
Asynchronously stop
\fBsearchd\fR, using the details of the PID file as specified in the
sphinx\&.conf
file, so you may also need to confirm to
\fBsearchd\fR
which configuration file to use with the
\fB\-\-config\fR
option\&. NB, calling
\fB\-\-stop\fR
will also make sure any changes applied to the indexes with
\fIUpdateAttributes()\fR
will be applied to the index files themselves\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-config /home/myuser/sphinx\&.conf \-\-stop
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-stopwait\fR
.RS 4
Synchronously stop
\fBsearchd\fR\&.
\fB\-\-stop\fR
essentially tells the running instance to exit (by sending it a
\fISIGTERM\fR) and then immediately returns\&.
\fB\-\-stopwait\fR
will also attempt to wait until the running
\fBsearchd\fR
instance actually finishes the shutdown (eg\&. saves all the pending attribute changes) and exits\&.
.sp
Example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ searchd \-\-config /home/myuser/sphinx\&.conf \-\-stopwait
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Possible exit codes are as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
0 on success;
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
1 if connection to running
\fBsearchd\fR
daemon failed;
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
2 if daemon reported an error during shutdown;
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
3 if daemon crashed during shutdown
.RE
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-strip\-path\fR
.RS 4
Strip the path names from all the file names referenced from the index (\fIstopwords\fR,
\fIwordforms\fR,
\fIexceptions\fR, etc)\&. This is useful for picking up indexes built on another machine with possibly different path layouts\&.
.RE
.SH "SIGNALS"
.PP
Last but not least, as every other daemon,
\fBsearchd\fR
supports a number of signals\&.
.PP
.PP
SIGTERM
.RS 4
Initiates a clean shutdown\&. New queries will not be handled; but queries that are already started will not be forcibly interrupted\&.
.RE
.PP
SIGHUP
.RS 4
Initiates index rotation\&. Depending on the value of
\fBseamless_rotate\fR
setting, new queries might be shortly stalled; clients will receive temporary errors\&.
.RE
.PP
SIGUSR1
.RS 4
Forces reopen of searchd log and query log files, letting you implement log file rotation\&.
